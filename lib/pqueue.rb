# Priority queue with array based heap.
#
# A priority queue is like a standard queue, except that each inserted
# elements is given a certain priority, based on the result of the
# comparison block given at instantiation time. Also, retrieving an element
# from the queue will always return the one with the highest priority
# (see #pop and #top).
#
# The default is to compare the elements in repect to their #<=> method.
# For example, Numeric elements with higher values will have higher
# priorities.
#
# Note that as of version 2.0 the internal queue is kept in the reverse order
# from how it was kept in previous version. If you had used #to_a in the
# past then be sure to adjust for the priorities to be ordered back-to-front
# instead of the oterh way around.
#

  #
  # Returns a new priority queue.
  #
  # If elements are given, build the priority queue with these initial
  # values. The elements object must respond to #to_a.
  #
  # If a block is given, it will be used to determine the priority between
  # the elements. The block must must take two arguments and return `1`, `0`,
  # or `-1` or `true`, `nil` or `false. It should return `0` or `nil` if the
  # two arguments are considered equal, return `1` or `true` if the first
  # argument is considered greater than the later, and `-1` or `false` if
  # the later is considred to be greater than the first.
  #
  # By default, the priority queue retrieves maximum elements first
  # using the #<=> method.
